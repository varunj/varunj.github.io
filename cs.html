Within days, 276,000 people had put down $1,000 to pre-order the car, an unprecedented demand. There may be no example of a new car attracting as much interest in the history of automotive industry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">But the Model 3 doesn&rsquo;t exist yet. There is no final production version, let alone any production. The company aims at starting deliveries by the end of 2017. But running on schedule isn&rsquo;t Tesla&rsquo;s strong suit it has been late in delivering all three current Tesla models. The Model X Crossover was delivered &nbsp;three and a half years after the promised date. Meanwhile, Tesla&rsquo;s current best-seller has been plagued by quality problems. Due to complaints including &ldquo;squeaks, rattles and leaks,&rdquo; not to mention problematic motors and brakes, Consumer Reports removed the Model S from its recommended list. Tesla largely repaired these flaws for free, and the company&rsquo;s image hasn&rsquo;t noticeably suffered, thankfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Tesla exists to give the planet a sustainable future, pointing to rising CO&#8322; levels, &nbsp;53,000 people die from air pollution from transportation. Like other electric cars, it has &ldquo;zero emissions&rdquo; of air pollution and CO&#8322;. But this is only true of the car itself; the electricity powering it is often produced with coal, which means that the clean car is responsible for heavy air pollution. If the USA had 10 per cent more petrol cars by 2020, air pollution would claim 870 more lives. A similar increase in electric ones would cause 1,617 more deaths a year, mostly because of the coal burned.If we were to scale this to the UK, electric cars would cause the same or more air pollution-related deaths than petrol-powered cars. In China, because their coal power plants are so dirty, electric cars make local air much worse: in Shanghai, pollution from more electric-powered cars would be nearly three-times as deadly as more petrol-powered ones! &nbsp;Over a 150,000 km lifetime, the top-line Tesla S will emit about 13 tonnes of CO&#8322;. But the production of its batteries alone will emit 14 tonnes, along with seven more from the rest of its production and eventual decommissioning. Compare this with the diesel-powered, but similarly performing, Audi A7 Sportback, which uses about seven litres per 100km, so about 10,500 litres over its lifetime. This makes 26 tonnes of CO&#8322;. The Audi will also emit slightly more than 7 tons in production and end-of-life. In total, the Tesla will emit 34 tonnes and the Audi 35. So over a decade, the Tesla will save the world around a tonne of CO&#8322;. Reducing a tonne of CO&#8322; on the EU emissions trading system costs &pound;5; but instead, the UK Government subsidises each car with &pound;4,500. All of the world&rsquo;s electric cars sold so far have soaked up &pound;9 billion in subsidies, yet will only save 3.3 million tonnes of CO&#8322;. This will reduce world temperatures by 0.00001&deg;C in 2100 &ndash; the equivalent of postponing global warming by about 30 minutes at the end of the century! &nbsp;It indeed is daft to waste billions of pounds of public money on rich people&rsquo;s playthings that kill more people through air pollution while barely affecting carbon emissions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The math gets trickier, though, when you include other forms of environmental damage. Electric cars need to be light, which means they include a lot of high-performing metals. The lithium in the batteries, for example, is super light and conductive&mdash;that&rsquo;s how you get a lot of energy without adding a lot of weight. Other, rare metals are sprinkled throughout the car, mostly in the magnets that are in everything from the headlights to the on-board electronics. But those rare metals come from somewhere&mdash;often, from environmentally destructive mines. It&rsquo;s not just Tesla, of course. All electric vehicles rely on parts with similar environmental issues. That damage is difficult to quantify, just like the impact of oil drilling. And, every stage of the process, mining has hidden emissions. Those spew a lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the process of refining a material destined for your zero-emissions car. In fact, manufacturing an electric vehicle generates more carbon emissions than building a conventional car, mostly because of its battery, the Union of Concerned Scientists has found. A Tesla battery is big&mdash;the pack in the Model S tops half a ton, far bigger than anything most e-recycling outfits take&mdash;so coming up with an efficient and cost-effective recycling process will take some work, and only a few companies specialize in recycling lithium batteries right now. &ldquo;The challenge that we have with recycling these rare metals is enormous,&rdquo; Abraham says, &ldquo;because the products that we have now use metals in such a small quantity that it&rsquo;s not economic to recycle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">At this point, the company is contemplating its production plans. To fund the necessary manufacturing buildout, talks are going on with advisers about raising a lot of new capital. Tesla will probably sell $3 billion in new shares.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The company is starting from scratch: The Model 3 is derivative of no prior model;Tesla must create entirely new assembly lines for the car . The Model 3 battery, too, will be new. The place where it will be made&ndash;The Gigafactory, the gigantic lithium-ion battery plant being built outside Nevada&ndash;&ldquo;has yet to make a single cell,&rdquo; .</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Finally, it&rsquo;s not as if Tesla&rsquo;s rivals are standing still. In addition to GM&rsquo;s Chevy Bolt, Nissan will produce a second-generation Leaf with the same 200-mile range and approximately $35,000 price; it will come in 2017. Before that, Toyota will deliver its Prius Prime, a plug-in hybrid; and BMW already has its pure electric i3. The other major carmakers are piling in as well by the end of the decade.The concern is the speed with which mid-priced electrics will come to market. GM&rsquo;s Chevy Bolt, for example&mdash;also priced at about $35,000, with a range exceeding 200 miles on a charge&mdash;will be in showrooms by the end of this year, the company says; whereas Tesla customers won&rsquo;t get their hands on a Model 3 until the end of 2017 at the earliest, and possibly not until 2019.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The hoopla in response to these vehicles may never approach that generated by the Model 3. But every time another electric shows up on the scene, Tesla risks losing customers to the incumbents&mdash;and has less wiggle room to miss the delivery deadlines. In terms of whether Musk is up to it, remember, this is the man who over the last decade has single-handedly validated both electric cars and private commercial space travel.</span></p><p class="c8"><span></span></p></body></html>
